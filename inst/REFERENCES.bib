In some forms, the said mass means regularly serves as a removable and replaceable striking head; while in other forms, the mass means comprises one or more thin elongated tubes having a frictionally-gripping fit on an elongated mallet body, so as to be manually slidable thereon but tight enough to avoid dislodgment under normal playing action; and such a tubular member may be slidable to the head-end of the mallet to serve as a striking head or it may be slidable to a position to serve as a hand grip; and one or more such tubular members may be placed in various positions along the length of the mallet. The mallet body may also have a tapered element at the head-end to assure retention of mass members especially of enlarged-head types; and the disclosure further includes such heads embodying a relatively hard inner portion and a relatively soft outer covering.}}

abstract={Abstract   Multivariable methods of analysis can yield problematic results if methodological guidelines and mathematical assumptions are ignored. A problem arising from a too-small ratio of events per variable (EPV) can affect regression coefficients' accuracy, precision and their statistical significance tests. The problem occurs when a proportional hazards analysis contains too few “failure” events (e.g., deaths) in relation to the number of included independent variables. In the current research, the impact of EPV was assessed for results of proportional hazards analysis done with Monte Carlo simulations in an empirical data set of 673 subjects enrolled in a multicenter trial of coronary artery bypass surgery.  The research is presented in two parts: Part I describes the data set and strategy used for the analyses, including the Monte Carlo simulation studies done to determine and compare the impact of various values of EPV in proportional hazards analytical results. Part II compares the output of regression models obtained from the simulations, and discusses the implication of the findings.}}

Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed.

abstract={PLS univariate regression is a model linking a dependent variable y to a set X = {x1 ;:::; xp} of (numerical or categorical) explanatory variables. It can be obtained as a series of simple and multiple regressions. By taking advantage from the statistical tests associated with linear regression, it is feasible to select the signi3cant explanatory variables to include in PLS regression and to choose the number of PLS components to retain. The principle of the presented algorithm may be similarly used in order to yield an extension of PLS regression to PLS generalised linear regression. The modi3cations to classical PLS regression, the case of PLS logistic regression and the application of PLS generalised linear regression to survival data are studied in detail. Some examples show the use of the proposed methods in real practice. As a matter of fact, classical PLS univariate regression is the result of an iterated use of ordinary least squares (OLS) where PLS stands for partial least squares. PLS generalised linear regression retains the rationale of PLS while the criterion optimised at each step is based on maximum likelihood. Nevertheless, the acronym PLS is kept as a reference to a general methodology for relating a response variable to a set of predictors. The approach proposed for PLS generalised linear regression is simple and easy to implement. Moreover, it can be easily generalised to any model that is linear at the level of the explanatory variables. c}}

abstract={Abstract   The PLS Cox regression has been proposed in the framework of PLS generalized linear regression as an alternative to the Cox model when dealing with highly correlated covariates. However, in high dimensional settings the algorithm becomes computer-intensive and a more efficient algorithm must be used. In this Article we propose an alternative both faster and easier to carry out by the direct use of standard procedures which are available in most statistical softwares. Recently, Segal suggested a solution to the Cox–Lasso algorithm when dealing with high dimensional data. Following Segal, we propose a Deviance Residuals based PLS regression (PLSDR) as an alternative to the PLS–Cox model in high dimensional settings. The PLSDR algorithm only needs to carry out null deviance residuals using a simple intercept Cox model and use these as outcome in a standard PLS regression. This algorithm which can be extended to kernels to deal with non-linearity can also be viewed as a variable selection method in a threshold penalized formulation. An application carried out on gene expression from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma shows the practical interest of using deviance residuals as outcomes in PLS regression when dealing with very many descriptors and censored data.}}

abstract={Motivation: A vast literature from the past decade is devoted to relating gene profiles and subject survival or time to cancer recurrence. Biomarker discovery from high-dimensional data, such as transcrip-tomic or single nucleotide polymorphism profiles, is a major challenge in the search for more precise diagnoses. The proportional hazard regression model suggested by Cox (1972), to study the relationship between the time to event and a set of covariates in the presence of censoring is the most commonly used model for the analysis of survival data. However, like multivariate regression, it supposes that more observations than variables, complete data, and not strongly correlated variables are available. In practice, when dealing with high-dimensional data, these constraints are crippling. Collinearity gives rise to issues of over-fitting and model misidentification. Variable selection can improve the estimation accuracy by effectively identifying the subset of relevant predictors and enhance the model interpretability with parsimonious representation. To deal with both collinearity and variable selection issues, many methods based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized Cox proportional hazards have been proposed since the reference paper of Tibshirani. Regularization could also be performed using dimension reduction as is the case with partial least squares (PLS) regression. We propose two original algorithms named sPLSDR and its non-linear kernel counterpart DKsPLSDR, by using sparse PLS regression (sPLS) based on deviance residuals. We compared their predicting performance with state-of-the-art algorithms on both simulated and real reference benchmark datasets. Results: sPLSDR and DKsPLSDR compare favorably with other methods in their computational time, prediction and selectivity, as indicated by results based on benchmark datasets. Moreover, in the framework of PLS regression, they feature other useful tools, including biplots representation, or the ability to deal with missing data. Therefore, we view them as a useful addition to the toolbox of estimation and prediction methods for the widely used Cox's model in the high-dimensional and low-sample size settings.

@Article{survivalROC,
   abstract = {ROC curves are a popular method for displaying sensitivity and specificity of a continuous diagnostic marker, X , for a binary disease variable, D. However, many disease outcomes are time dependent, D (t) , and ROC curves that vary as a function of time may be more appropriate. A common example of a time-dependent variable is vital status, where D (t) = 1 if a patient has died prior t o time t and zero otherwise. We propose summarizing the discrimination potential of a marker X , measured at baseline (t = O), by calculating ROC curves for cumulative disease or death incidence by time t , which we denote as ROC(t). A typical complexity with survival data is that observations may be censored. Two ROC curve estimators are proposed that can accommodate censored data. A simple estimator is based on using the Kaplan-Meier estimator for each possible subset X > c. However, this estimator does not guarantee the necessary condition that sensitivity and specificity are monotone in X. An alternative estimator that does guarantee monotonicity is based on a nearest neighbor estimator for the bivariate distribution function of (X , T) , where T represents survival time (Akritas, M. J., 1994, Annuls of Statistics 22, 1299-1327). We present an example where ROC(t) is used to compare a standard and a modified flow cytometry measurement for predicting survival after detection of breast cancer and an example where the ROC(t) curve displays the impact of modifying eligibility criteria for sample size and power in HIV prevention trials.},

   abstract = {The prediction reliability is of primary concern in many clinical studies when the objective is to develop new predictive models or improve existing risk scores. In fact, before using a model in any clinical decision making, it is very important to check its ability to discriminate between subjects who are at risk of, for example, developing certain disease in a near future from those who will not. To that end, the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is the most commonly used method in practice. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to estimate the ROC nonparametrically in the context of survival data. But, except one recent approach, all the existing methods provide a nonsmooth ROC estimator whereas, by definition, the ROC curve is smooth. In this Article we propose and study a new nonparametric smooth ROC estimator based on a weighted kernel smoother. More precisely, our approach relies on a well-known kernel method used to estimate cumulative distribution functions of random variables with bounded supports. We derived some asymptotic properties for the proposed estimator. As bandwidth is the main parameter to be set, we present and study different methods to appropriately select one. A simulation study is conducted, under different scenarios, to prove the consistency of the proposed method and to compare its finite sample performance with a competitor. The results show that the proposed method performs better and appear to be quite robust to bandwidth choice. As for inference purposes, our results also reveal the good performances of a proposed nonparametric bootstrap procedure. Furthermore, we illustrate the method using a real data example.},
