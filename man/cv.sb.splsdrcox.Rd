\item{MIN_EPV}{Numeric. Minimum number of Events Per Variable (EPV) you want reach for the final
cox model. Used to restrict the number of variables/components can be computed in final cox models.

\item{return_models}{Logical. Return all models computed in cross validation (default: FALSE).}

\item{returnData}{Logical. Return original and normalized X and Y matrices (default: TRUE).}

\item{PARALLEL}{Logical. Run the cross validation with multicore option. As many cores as your
total cores - 1 will be used. It could lead to higher RAM consumption (default: FALSE).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If verbose = TRUE, extra messages could be displayed (default: FALSE).}

\description{
This function performs cross-validated sparse partial least squares single block for splsdrcox.
The function returns the optimal number of components and the optimal sparsity penalty value based
on cross-validation. The performance could be based on multiple metrics as Area Under the Curve
(AUC), Brier Score or C-Index. Furthermore, the user could establish more than one metric
simultaneously.
}
\details{
The \code{cv.sb.splsdrcox} function performs cross-validation for the single-block sparse partial least
squares deviance residual Cox analysis. Cross-validation is a robust method to evaluate the
performance of a statistical model by partitioning the original sample into a training set to train
the model, and a test set to evaluate it. This helps in selecting the optimal hyperparameters for
the model, such as the number of latent components (\code{max.ncomp}) and the penalty for variable
selection (\code{penalty.list}).

The function systematically evaluates different combinations of hyperparameters by performing
multiple runs and folds. For each combination, the dataset is divided into training and test sets
based on the specified number of folds (\code{k_folds}). The model is then trained on the training set
and evaluated on the test set. This process is repeated for the specified number of runs (\code{n_run}),
ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across different partitions of the
data.

Various evaluation metrics, such as AIC, C-Index, Brier Score, and AUC, are computed for each
combination of hyperparameters. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy,
discriminative ability, and calibration. The function then identifies the optimal hyperparameters
that yield the best performance based on the specified evaluation metrics.

The function also offers flexibility in data preprocessing, such as centering and scaling of the
explanatory variables, removal of near-zero variance variables, and more. Additionally, users can
specify the AUC evaluation algorithm method (\code{pred.method}) and control the verbosity of the
output (\code{verbose}).

The output provides a comprehensive overview of the cross-validation results, including detailed
information at the fold, run, and component levels. Visualization tools, such as plots for AIC,
C-Index, Brier Score, and AUC, are also provided to aid in understanding the model's performance
across different hyperparameters.

In summary, the \code{cv.sb.splsdrcox} function offers a robust approach for hyperparameter tuning and
model evaluation for the single-block sparse partial least squares deviance residual Cox analysis.
It ensures that the final model is both accurate and generalizable to new data.
